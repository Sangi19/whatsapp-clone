<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This a JavaScript React clone Project which duplicates the popular application of "Whatsapp". The technologies I have used are Google Authentication for login, JavaScript React code in VS Code Editor for the webapp and Firebase to store and retrieve the data and messages
<br />

## Technical Components
 The technologies I have used in this Whatsapp Application are Google Authentication for login, JavaScript React code in VS Code Editor for the webapp and Firebase to store and retrieve the data and messages. <br />

### React - Load Posts at real-time. Instead of refreshing the whole page, particular components will be altered.

### Firebase firestore Realtime db - handles the background job to store and retrieve the messages and chat rooms.

### Google Auth - Google authentication helps us to login using Google Mail ids (GMAIL)

### Material UI - It is used for the Icons for whatsapp application.

### React Router -  It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL

### Deploy using Firebase - Deployed the app using Firebase
